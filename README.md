- 👋 Hi, I’m @khoelck0315
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Finding an open source project to contribue to, and working on my many personal projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... C#
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Any web projects involving PHP/Laravel, or any .NET projects.

# My Current PHP projects
- Expanding my laravel-portfolio page to add more content.  And eventually, a blog.

# My Current .NET Projects
- A parental control application for windows using a windows service with a WPF frontend to control screen time.
- A kid-safe Chromium based browser written in .NET
- A vulnerability remediation tool
- A console application comparing user data from three different systems, and parsing that data into a spreadsheet to present the results
